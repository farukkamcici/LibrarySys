# Library Management System

This project implements a simple Library Management System using object-oriented programming techniques in Python. It allows users to manage a list of books stored in a text file and perform operations such as listing books, adding books, and removing books from the library database.

## Features

- **List Books**: Display all the books currently stored in the library database.
- **Add Book**: Add a new book to the library database.
- **Remove Book**: Remove a book from the library database.
- **Quit**: End the program.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/farukkamcici/LibrarySys.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd LibrarySys
    ```

3. Run the `main.py` file:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Library Management System.

## File Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the main implementation of the Library Management System.
- **books.txt**: Text file acting as the database for storing book information.

## Usage

- Upon running the program, a menu is displayed with options to list books, add a book, remove a book, or quit the program.
